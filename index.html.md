### Background

**Why does this exist?** I like using langgraph. Modeling reasoning
processes as graphs makes sense. However, there’s a few problems that
make it difficult for me. First of all, I have a terrible memory. I
really can’t memorize a constantly changing API, and I get tired looking
up stuff I don’t remember. And if I’m thinking of a graph, with nodes
and edges, the langgraph architecture is great. I just don’t know all
the variations of it off the top of my head. All I know is a sort of
state graph like: `START -> do_something -> END`

Now I want to code that up in langgraph. What do I need? Exactly how do
I code these? It’s not at all clear given a notation like this:
`START -> node_1 -> node_2 -> END`

This tool let’s you define graphs this way, and writes functioning
langgraph code.

### Example Graphs in this notation

These graphs are taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCDrAbH_go

``` python
bea_basic = """START -> generate_joke
generate_joke -> check_punchline(improve_joke, END)
improve_joke -> polish_joke -> END
"""

bea_parallel = """START -> call_llm_1, call_llm_2, call_llm_3 -> aggregator -> END"""

bea_orchestrator_worker = """START -> orchestrator -> llm_call(*sections) -> synthesizer -> END"""
```

#### Building Effective Agents, Basic example

#### Step 1: break into pairs

All operations after this use: - graph_name – used in code generation -
graph_notation – see examples, only 4 patters: simple transition
`A -> B`, parallel destinations `A -> B, C, D` - graph_data – pairs of
related graph entities, where each node transitions to

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### The Plan

We start with the Graph Notation, and do the following:

1.  break graph into edges, just a tuple (“A”, “B”) from notation
    `A -> B`
2.  handle parallel branching, a tuple (“A”, “B,C,D”) becomes (“A”,
    “B”), (“A”, C”), (“A”, “D”)
3.  handle conditional edges, notation: “condition_fn(node_1, node_2)”
4.  write state code
5.  write node code
6.  write conditional edge code
7.  write worker function code
8.  write graph builder code
9.  write graph runner code
